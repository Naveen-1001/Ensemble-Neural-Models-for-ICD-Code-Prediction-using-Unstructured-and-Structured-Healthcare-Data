Metoprolol 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\r\\n\\r\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired and had been living\\r\\nat home with his wife prior to his admission to the hospital\\r\\non [**2101-10-11**]; he had been living at [**Hospital3 1761**] for the day prior to admission.  He is a\\r\\nsocial drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;\\r\\nalthough, he quit smoking 20 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical\\r\\nexamination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,\\r\\nheart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following\\r\\nadministration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory\\r\\nwas 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal\\r\\ncannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There\\r\\nwere normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6\\r\\nsystolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.\\r\\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His\\r\\nabdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were\\r\\nhypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft\\r\\npulse, [**Hospital3 17394**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis\\r\\npulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,\\r\\nand intact.  Please note that the above examination was done\\r\\nby the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was\\r\\ninitially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial\\r\\nlaboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell\\r\\ncount of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets\\r\\nwere 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR\\r\\nwas 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,\\r\\npotassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood\\r\\nurea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose\\r\\nwas 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and\\r\\nphosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were\\r\\npending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on\\r\\nadmission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out\\r\\nyeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also\\r\\ninitially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.\\r\\n\\r\\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated\\r\\nstable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no\\r\\nfocal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of\\r\\nthe chest compared with a [**2101-10-15**] study.  No\\r\\nradiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or\\r\\npneumonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,\\r\\nnonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages\\r\\nin the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when\\r\\ncompared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2101-10-12**].\\r\\n\\r\\nAn initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination\\r\\nthat demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No\\r\\nevidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,\\r\\nincompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple\\r\\nleft renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and\\r\\npartially calcified prostate gland.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to\\r\\nthe Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased\\r\\nurine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary\\r\\nto a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were\\r\\nnever any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the\\r\\nnight of admission, the patient had a sudden\\r\\ncardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with\\r\\nepinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion\\r\\ntimes four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing these measures, the patient returned to a sinus\\r\\nrhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;\\r\\nthe total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to\\r\\nthe return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He\\r\\nsubsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood\\r\\npressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a\\r\\ntrivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection\\r\\nfraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a\\r\\nhyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided\\r\\nfilling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this\\r\\narrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a\\r\\nnon-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were\\r\\nelevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nA repeat echocardiogram done on [**2101-10-21**]\\r\\ndemonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction\\r\\nof 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities\\r\\nincluding inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular\\r\\nakinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and\\r\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study\\r\\nof [**2101-10-20**]; the left ventricular function was\\r\\nunchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the\\r\\nright ventricular function appeared worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn [**2101-10-21**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone\\r\\nand was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The\\r\\nfollowing day, he was started on heparin intravenously given\\r\\nhis elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this\\r\\nmedication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated\\r\\ntroponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient\\r\\nwas a candidate for cardiac catheterization.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit\\r\\nteam and the patient's family, however, the decision was made\\r\\nto not pursue further invasive procedures given that the\\r\\npatient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate\\r\\nfollowing the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family\\r\\nno longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy [**2101-10-23**], he was off pressors and he was\\r\\nrestarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of [**2101-10-25**], the patient complained\\r\\nof substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and\\r\\nmorphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3\\r\\nthat reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.\\r\\nTherefore, the patient was again started on heparin;\\r\\nalthough, this was discontinued on [**2101-10-26**] when\\r\\nthe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\r\\nenzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on [**2101-10-27**]; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he\\r\\nagain ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac\\r\\nenzymes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence\\r\\nof congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid\\r\\nresuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.\\r\\nBy the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service\\r\\non [**2101-10-26**], the patient was still significantly\\r\\nvolume overloaded following his aggressive fluid\\r\\nresuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,\\r\\nhe was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that\\r\\nhe was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive\\r\\nheart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of\\r\\nhis discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was\\r\\ngreater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on\\r\\ngentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the\\r\\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already\\r\\ntaking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to\\r\\nadmission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative\\r\\nurosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous\\r\\nfluids.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn [**2101-10-21**], his levofloxacin and metronidazole was\\r\\ndiscontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the\\r\\ngrowth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of\\r\\ngentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was\\r\\ndiscontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious\\r\\nDisease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on\\r\\n[**2101-10-28**], and his piperacillin/tazobactam was\\r\\ndiscontinued on [**2101-10-29**].\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis\\r\\nprecipitating this admission, the patient did not have any\\r\\npositive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of\\r\\nyeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained\\r\\nafebrile both before and after discontinuation of his\\r\\nantibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile\\r\\nnegative on [**2101-10-28**].\\r\\n\\r\\n3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and\\r\\nhe was extubated on [**2101-10-24**].  He subsequently\\r\\ndeveloped wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to\\r\\ncardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his\\r\\naggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed\\r\\ntoward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his\\r\\nhe was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%\\r\\non 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium\\r\\nnebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his\\r\\nrespiratory secretions.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure\\r\\nand prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid\\r\\nresuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum\\r\\ncreatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly\\r\\nmalnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once\\r\\nhe was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a\\r\\nmodified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin\\r\\nliquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,\\r\\nsmall bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and\\r\\naspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with\\r\\nand between meals for nutritional supplementation of his\\r\\nheart-healthy/diabetic diet.\\r\\n\\r\\n6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot\\r\\nulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was\\r\\nstarted on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved\\r\\nwound healing.\\r\\n\\r\\n7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of\\r\\npacked red blood cells on [**2101-10-27**] to maintain a\\r\\nhematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe\\r\\ncoronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently\\r\\nremained stable.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.\\r\\n\\r\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehabilitation facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\r\\n 1.

the patient is retired and had been living at home with his wife prior to his admission to the hospital on for the day prior to admission he is a social drinker and has a 40 pack year smoking history although he quit smoking 20 years ago physical examination on presentation initial physical examination revealed temperature was 961 degrees fahrenheit heart rate was 83 blood pressure was 124 42 following administration of 3 liters of normal saline respiratory was 24 and his oxygen saturation was 100 on 2 liters nasal cannula his heart had a regular rate and rhythm there were normal first and second heart sounds there was a 2 6 systolic ejection murmur and there were no rubs or gallops his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally his abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended and there were hypoactive bowel sounds he had a palpable bypass graft pulse dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally and his surgical incision was clean dry and intact please note that the above examination was done by the vascular surgery team which was the team that was initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital pertinent laboratory data on presentation on initial laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell count of 127 hematocrit was 302 and platelets were 282 000 his pt was 135 ptt was 307 and inr was 13 his serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136 potassium was 54 chloride was 99 bicarbonate was 25 blood urea nitrogen was 53 creatinine was 32 and blood glucose was 91 his calcium was 82 magnesium was 24 and phosphate was 48 blood cultures drawn on admission were pending but ultimately negative a urine culture taken on admission was initially pending but ultimately grew out yeast a sputum culture taken on admission was also initially pending but ultimately also grew out yeast radiology imaging his admission chest x ray demonstrated stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery no focal areas of consolidation overall stable appearance of the chest compared with a study no radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia his admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm nonspecific inferior lateral t wave changes low qrs voltages in the limb leads and t wave changes in v5 and v6 when compared with an electrocardiogram dated an initial abdominal ct was a limited noncontrast examination that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications no evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification a simple left renal cyst sigmoid diverticulosis and an enlarged and partially calcified prostate gland hospital course by system 1 cardiovascular the patient was initially admitted to the vascular intensive care unit with hypotension decreased urine output and acute renal failure most likely secondary to a presumed gram negative urosepsis although there were never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis while boarding in the medical intensive care unit on the night of admission the patient had a sudden cardiorespiratory arrest he was resuscitated with epinephrine lidocaine and direct current cardioversion times four he was also intubate for airway protection following these measures the patient returned to a sinus rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100 the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes he subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood pressure an echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 25 in the setting of tachycardia and a hyperdynamic right ventricle suggesting elevated right sided filling pressures although the definitive etiology of this arrest remained unknown the most likely trigger was a non q wave myocardial infarction as his troponin values were elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest a repeat echocardiogram done on demonstrated mild left atrial dilation an ejection fraction of 15 to 20 resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferior mid and apical left ventricular akinesis depressed right ventricular systolic function and moderate mitral regurgitation compared with the prior study of the left ventricular function was unchanged there was moderate mitral regurgitation and the right ventricular function appeared worse on the patient was loaded with amiodarone and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone the following day he was started on heparin intravenously given his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50 this medication was continued for 72 hours given his elevated troponins and non q wave myocardial infarction the patient was a candidate for cardiac catheterization after discussions between the medical intensive care unit team and the patient s family however the decision was made to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the patient had been made do not resuscitate do not intubate following the resuscitation mentioned above and his family no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures by he was off pressors and he was restarted on a beta blocker and ace inhibitor at low doses on the evening of the patient complained of substernal chest pain that was relieved by npg sl and morphine he also had st segment depressions in v2 and v3 that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain therefore the patient was again started on heparin although this was discontinued on when the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes he again had substernal chest pain on although he had no electrocardiogram changes and he again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes by hospital day four the patient began to develop evidence of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid resuscitation and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun by the time of his transfer to the general medicine service on the patient was still significantly volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid resuscitation in the medical intensive care unit therefore he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that he was having signs and symptoms of right sided congestive heart failure he achieved adequate diuresis by the time of his discharge to rehabilitation as his oxygen saturation was greater than 95 on 2 liters nasal cannula 2 infectious disease sepsis the patient was started on gentamicin and piperacillin tazobactam in addition to the levofloxacin metronidazole and vancomycin he was already taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram negative urosepsis and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous fluids on his levofloxacin and metronidazole was discontinued and he was started on fluconazole given the growth of yeast on urine culture he was taken off of gentamicin on hospital day three and his fluconazole was discontinued on hospital day five as per the infectious disease service he was taken off of vancomycin on and his piperacillin tazobactam was discontinued on despite the presumption of a gram negative urosepsis precipitating this admission the patient did not have any positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of yeast in two urine cultures noted above he remained afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his antibiotics and he was found to be clostridium difficile negative on 3 pulmonary as noted above the patient was intubated and he was extubated on he subsequently developed wheezing and mild hypoxia most likely secondary to cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his aggressive fluid resuscitation he was gently diuresed toward the end of his hospitalization and by the time of his he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95 on 2 liters nasal cannula intermittent ipratropium nebulizers and chest physical therapy for clearance of his respiratory secretions 4 renal the patient presented with acute renal failure and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid resuscitation by the time of discharge his serum creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline 5 nutrition the patient was found to be profoundly malnourished with a serum albumin of 18 on admission once he was extubated and taking orals he performed poorly on a modified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin liquid ground solid diet with whole medication tablets small bites and sips upright posture with meals and aspiration precautions he was also given promod shakes with and between meals for nutritional supplementation of his heart healthy diabetic diet 6 vascular the patient s operative incisions and foot ulcers continued to heal throughout this admission he was started on an multivitamin vitamin c and zinc for improved wound healing 7 hematology the patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells on to maintain a hematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe coronary artery disease his hematocrit subsequently remained stable condition at discharge condition on discharge was stable discharge status rehabilitation facility discharge diagnoses 1 cardiorespiratory arrest 2 non q wave myocardial infarction 3
